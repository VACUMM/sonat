  abstract = {In the Bay of Biscay and the English Channel, in situ observations represent a key element to monitor and to understand the wide range of processes in the coastal ocean and their direct impacts on human activities. An efficient way to measure the hydrological content of the water column over the main part of the continental shelf is to consider ships of opportunity as the surface to cover is wide and could be far from the coast. In the French observation strategy, the RECOPESCA programme, as a component of the High frequency Observation network for the environment in coastal SEAs (HOSEA), aims to collect environmental observations from sensors attached to fishing nets. In the present study, we assess that network using the Array Modes (ArM) method (a stochastic implementation of Le H{\'e}naff et al. Ocean Dyn 59: 3--20. doi: 10.1007/s10236-008-0144-7 , 2009). That model ensemble-based method is used here to compare model and observation errors and to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the observation network at detecting prior (model) uncertainties, based on hypotheses on error sources. A reference network, based on fishing vessel observations in 2008, is assessed using that method. Considering the various seasons, we show the efficiency of the network at detecting the main model uncertainties. Moreover, three scenarios, based on the reference network, a denser network in 2010 and a fictive network aggregated from a pluri-annual collection of profiles, are also analysed. Our sensitivity study shows the importance of the profile positions with respect to the sheer number of profiles for ensuring the ability of the network to describe the main error modes. More generally, we demonstrate the capacity of this method, with a low computational cost, to assess and to design new in situ observation networks.},

  abstract  = {The development of coastal ocean modeling in the recent years has allowed an improved representation of the associated complex physics. Such models have become more realistic, to the point that they can now be used to design observation networks in coastal areas, with the idea that a ``good'' network is a network that controls model state error. To test this ability without performing data assimilation, we set up a technique called Representer Matrix Spectra (RMS) technique that combines the model state and observation error covariance matrices into a single scaled representer matrix. Examination of the spectrum and the eigenvectors of that matrix informs us on which model state error modes a network can detect and constrain amidst the observation error background. We applied our technique to a 3D coastal model in the Bay of Biscay, with a focus on mesoscale activity, and tested the performance of various altimetry networks and an in situ array deployment strategy. It appears that a single nadir altimeter is not efficient enough at capturing coastal mesoscale physics, while a wide swath altimeter would do a much better job. Testing various local in situ array configurations confirms that adding a current meter to a vertical temperature measurement array improves the detection of secondary variability modes, while shifting the array higher on the shelf break would obviously enhance the model constraint along the coast. The RMS technique is easily set up and used as a ``black box,'' but the utility of its results is maximized by previous knowledge of model state error physics. The technique provides both quantitative (eigenvalues) and qualitative (eigenvectors) tools to study and compare various network options. The qualitative approach is essential to discard possibly inconsistent modes.},

  abstract  = {The generalized inverse method of Bennett and McIntosh (1982) is used to assess the efficiency of instrument arrays with observe deterministic fields. The arrays considered are combinations of points at which bottom pressures are observed (Cartwright, 1978), plus paths along which averaged barotropic velocities are observed, by the acoustic tomography technique of reciprocal shooting (Munk and Wunsch, 1982a,b). The barotropic M2 tide is used as an example of a field which is being observed by the array, and for which an interpolation or smoothing is required. The treatment of observations of individual inter-annual events would be similar. It is shown that the generalized inverse method for the objective analysis of deterministic fields is formally identical to the Gandin (1965) method for the objective analysis of random fields. Construction of the generalized inverse requires the inversion of an Hermitian positive definite matrix. Array efficiency is characterized by the number of significant eigenvalues of the matrix. The admission of errors in the observations and dynamics necessitates the choice of weights in a variational principle. The choice is made by prior estimation of the relative error variances. It is also necessary to choose locally singular weighting functions for the dynamics, in order to ensure non-singular interpolating or smoothing fields. The dominant array modes are defined and constructed. These are the interpolating fields which make the most stable contribution to the generalized inverse. An example of inversion is carried out using simulated data.},

  abstract  = {This is a study of inverse methods for estimating the surface circulation of the equatorial Pacific, by combining a linear, reduced-gravity shallow-water model with the Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere ship-of-opportunity expendable bathythermograph (TOGA SOP XBT) observing program. The circulation of interest has large spatial scales and interannual time scales. The temporal structure is parameterized with a few frequencies, which provide a sufficiently accurate description over the 2-year data-smoothing interval. No predictive skill is implied, beyond the smoothing interval. A circulation is sought as the weighted least squares best fit to the dynamics and the data; thus the approach is formally that of an inverse problem in which forcing fields are estimated from noisy observations of the circulation. These observations are not the original temperature data, which are randomly scattered along the ship tracks. Instead, an orderly data set is defined by projecting the data onto Hermite functions of latitude. The projections could be summed and sampled at regular intervals along the tracks, but the projections themselves suffice as smoothed yet still somewhat noisy data. The number of measurements becomes the number of tracks (13) multiplied by the number of Hermite projections or moments (6), that is, 78 measurements at each of three frequencies (0.25 cpy, 0.5 cpy, 1.0 cpy). Each measurement may be described mathematically by a linear functional. The best fit minimizes a quadratic cost functional and is expressed as a sum of the influence functions or representers associated with the cost functional (which makes roughness expensive) and the measurement functionals. The sum of representers is finite, as there is one representer per measurement. Unobservable circulations are discarded by the minimization algorithm. It is shown that the representer expansion is closely related to Gauss-Markov smoothing or “objective analysis,” and also to the inverse method of Backus and Gilbert (1970). The analysis of the inverse using representers yields an Hermitian nonnegative matrix which characterizes the efficiency of the XBT observing program or “array.” Spectral decomposition of the matrix also yields modes for the circulation and for the forcing (solution array modes (SAMs) and residual array modes (RAMs), respectively), which are linear combinations of the representers and their dynamical residuals, respectively, and are the patterns most stably estimated by the inverse. The inverse assumes that a prior estimate has been made for the forcing, corresponding to which there is a prior estimate of circulation. The data may be regarded as prior estimates of measurements of the true circulation. The inverse also assumes that error covariances for these prior estimates are available. The results of the inverse calculation include posterior estimates for the errors in the prior forcing estimates, for the prior circulation estimates, and for the measurements. The representers and their residuals, or equivalentIy the SAMs and RAMs, yield the error covariances for these posterior estimates. Finally the reduction of the cost functional may be expressed in terms of the trace of the Hermitian representer matrix. The dynamics and the measurement functionals are linear while the cost functional is quadratic. Consequently, the structure described above does not depend on any realization of the circulation and may be determined once and for all. The structure is computed here for various choices of oceanic phase speed, forcing error statistics and measurement error statistics. The robustness of the inverse is also tested with synthetic forcing and data which variously are or are not consistent with the assumed prior statistics. The approach taken here is placed in the context of other variational assimilation schemes.},
